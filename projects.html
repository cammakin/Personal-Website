		<h4>Implementing Cryptography on an FPGA + Microprocessor (Hardware Acceleration)</h4>
		<p>Sponsored by SecureRF, I worked alongside 2 other computer engineering students with the goal of optimizing a computationally extensive function of SecureRF's crypto algorithms called. The optimization is device specific as provided by SecureRF (MicroSemi SmartFusion2 SoC FPGA). As a group, we took the provided C implementation and optimized the E-multiplication operation in hardware (FPGA + Verilog) as well as with modified Assembly routines in order to achieve the highest throughput, lowest latency, and least amount of memory usage as possible. We reached our goal by creating implementations that were significantly faster than the originally provided C implementation. To read about E-multiplication or other relevant information regarding these efforts, please head over to SecureRF's White Papers webpage.</p>

		This  section of projects displays my enthusiasm and ability to work with Microcontrollers. (Please allow a few additional moments for all content to be loaded. There are video demos of many of my projects.)
