I have a role in ensuring vehicles and all of their sensors (such as LiDAR, Radar, Cameras) are in working condition. During this internship, I have learned and implemented several pieces of software (written in Python) to aid in the calibration process. </p>

This project was intended to teach OOP to students enrolled in an entry level programming course at Penn State. To create an effective learning tool, Java was used to create a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that is easy to look at, making the leaning process easier than simply reading a textbook. The course taught OOP in C++, so while I developed the GUI in Java, the content on the GUI was oriented towards a C++ curriculum. In order to create an effective tool, brief research was done in order to see how a GUI can be the most impactful for a students' education.</p>

Throughout the summer I collaborated with another intern to design website mockups utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and AngularJS. We were part of an Agile team responsible for creating new websites on Erie Insurance's intranet agent portal.<br><br>Throughout this internship I learned about how large companies operate; especially companies that are heavily reliant on software. I also got a great experience learning how the Agile project management style operates.</p>

During my time there, I learned about the basics of networking in the scope of the entire school district (13 buildings in total). In addition, I also helped tear down and setup classrooms with integrated technology (e.g. desktops, smartboards, projectors). Having the opportunity to be exposed to IT work before college aided in my decision to steer towards engineering over networking.</p>
